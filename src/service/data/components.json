    "longDescription": "The BC Gov OpenShift Container Platform Service is a multi-tenant container platform that government application development teams may use to develop and deploy modern, cloud native software applications. The service provides development teams with a set of isolated project spaces (namespaces) with associated resource quotas in which they can develop and deploy their applications and tools supporting their development lifecycle - from day-to-day development through to production.  \n #### Features & Functions \nThe core of the service is an instance of Red Hat's OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) running in the government data centre in Kamloops. Details of the configuration of the BC Gov OCP instance are as follows: \n - multi-tenant deployment, with RBAC and software defined network providing isolation between teams' environments \n - highly-available OCP deployment with ability to perform maintenance with no/minimal impact to applications running on it \n - 2 factor authentication and authorization provided via GitHub OAuth integration \n - standard set of project spaces provided to teams is tools (for development lifecycle support tools such as CI, automated testing, and code quality tools), dev, test, and prod\n - each corresponding to a deployment stage. \n - dynamically provisioned persistent storage backed by containerized Gluster (aka CNS and OCS) and/or dedicated NetApp storage \n - resource quotas associated with each project space; these quotas have been set at levels adequate to support the development activities and production deployment workloads for many typical government applications \n - a catalog of pre-defined technology stacks/tools to provide \"application quick starts\" or fully functional services to applications. \n\nRead more [here](https://github.com/bcgov/ols-geocoder/tree/gh-pages)",
